# What is Wheelhouse?

Wheelhouse is a customizable application boiplate currently written with Express and MongoDB in mind.

## Applications are **hard**

There is a lot of planning that goes into crafting a great application.
* Where do I start?
* What tools do I use?
* How do I keep my code maintainable?

How many times have you had a great idea for an app but were turned off with the amount of planning or the staggering amount
of boilerplate code you have write?

This is where we come in.

Coming soon...
