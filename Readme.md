#Application Boilerplate

This Application Boilerplate is a growing small batch of some key application features. The goal of this
Boilerplate is to be a simple to use and understand, but still offers a large ammount of functionality
and quick-customization. 


~	At the moment this project is very small. It is hardly a boilerplate, but I hope to be able to
	keep adding to this. There is not much documentation yet either, but it will start to come soon
	as the foundation is lain. The demo will feature an angular implementation, but I hope to expand
	this to several different common methods (jQuery, React, Vue, Angular2, ...etc) to provide a 
	more complete application boilerplate.



If you think this idea is cool, feel free to contribute!
